* ##What’s different between struct and class?

    Category                     | Struct    | Class 
    -----------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------
    Parameterless Constructor    | No        | Yes 
    Type                         | Value     | Reference 
    Sealed                       | Default   | Optional 
    Abstract                     | No        | Yes
    Inheritance                  | Interface | Interface, Class, Abstract Class
    Dispose                      | No        | Yes
    
  1. Struct can't have explicit parameterless constrcutor.
  2. Struct is value type. Class is reference type.
  3. Struct can't be abstract. Class can be abstract.
  4. Struct is sealed type as default. Class can be delcared as sealed type.
  5. Struct can't inheritance. Class can inheritance.
  6. Struct can't dipose. Class can dipose.
  7. Struct support interface. Class support interface.

* ##What happens if you assign a struct to an interface variable?
  Boxing would take place. Here is the definition from MSDN.
  
  > Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type
  
  The method in interface are define as virtual abstract. To resolve a virtual reference, vtable look up is required. Since there is no vtable in value type, compiler first boxs the value type into reference type and looks up later.
  Boxing causes the generation of temprary object and drops the performance. Furthormore, it is easy to cause code defect. Here is the example.
  ```C#
  class Program
  {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          Person Vic = new Person(28);
          Console.WriteLine("Vic is " + Vic + " years old");

          IAgeAdder Adder = Vic; // box happen
          Adder.Plus();
          Console.WriteLine("Vic is " + Vic + " years old"); // Vic is still the value type and the same as before
          Console.WriteLine("Adder is " + Adder + " years old"); // Adder refers to a temp object,generated by boxing
      }
  }

  struct Person : IAgeAdder
  {
      private int _age;

      public Person(int age)
      {
          _age = age;
      }

      public override string ToString()
      {
          return _age.ToString();
      }
      void IAgeAdder.Plus() { ++_age; }
  }

  interface IAgeAdder
  {
      void Plus();
  }  
  ```
