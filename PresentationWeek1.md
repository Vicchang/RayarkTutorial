## Please explain SOLID principles of object-oriented programming.
### 1. Single responsibility principle
#### Look at the code below. The Monster could go with specific way, which was X and Y plus one. 
    
```C#
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        GameObject GO = new GameObject();
        Monster M = new Monster(ref GO);
        M.Go();
    }
}

public class Monster
{
    private GameObject _m_gameObject;

    public Monster(GameObject gameObject)
    {
        _m_gameObject = gameObject;
    }

    public void Go()
    {
        _m_gameObject.X = _m_gameObject.X + 1;
        _m_gameObject.Y = _m_gameObject.Y + 1;
    }
}
```
#### However, one day, someone requested that could the monster go with different way? The engineer quickly modified the code, which would be like below.    
```C#
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        GameObject GO = new GameObject();
        Monster M = new Monster(ref GO);
        bool go_method_0 = false; bool go_method_1 = true;

        if (true == go_method_0) M.Go();
        else if (true == go_method_1) M.Go_v1();
    }
}    

public class Monster
{
    ...
    
    public void Go_v1()
    {
        _m_gameObject.X = _m_gameObject.X + 2;
        _m_gameObject.Y = _m_gameObject.Y + 2;
    }
}    
```
#### Unfotunately, someday, his boss requested the monster to go with one hundred new different ways. The engineer was stuck. The tragedy happend because it broke the "Single Responsibility Principle". The Monster class decided not only Monster should go but also how the monster go. The Monster class should leave how the monster go to other class to decide. In that case, we seperate the task or the responsibility to other class. Single responsibility principle encourages that one class should only do one task. Below is a simple code to illustate the idea.
```C#
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        GameObject GO1 = new GameObject();
        MoveBase Mm1 = new MonsterMove_v1(ref GO1);
        Monster M1 = new Monster(ref Mm1);
        M1.Go();
    }
} 

public class Monster
{
    private MoveBase _move;

    public Monster(MoveBase monsterMove)
    {
        _move = monsterMove;
    }

    public void Go()
    {
        IMove_v1 m = _move as IMove_v1;
        m.Foward();
    }
}

public abstract class MoveBase
{
    protected GameObject _m_GameObject;

    public MoveBase(GameObject gameObject)
    {
        _m_GameObject = gameObject;
    }
}

public interface IMove_v1
{
    void Foward();
}

public class MonsterMove_v2 : MoveBase, IMove_v1
{
    public MonsterMove_v2(GameObject gameObject) : base(gameObject) {}

    void IMove_v1.Foward()
    {
        _m_GameObject.X = _m_GameObject.X + 2;
        _m_GameObject.Y = _m_GameObject.Y + 2;
    }
}
```

### 2. Open/closed principles
#### The basic idea is that "a module or clsaa is open for extension and close for modification". As you can see from above, Monster class is now responsible for one task. It is now easy to extend new move method without touching the original one. Please read the example below.
```C#
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        GameObject GO1 = new GameObject();
        GameObject GO2 = new GameObject();
        MoveBase Mm1 = new MonsterMove_v1(ref GO1);
        MoveBase Mm2 = new MonsterMove_v2(ref GO2);
        Monster M1 = new Monster(ref Mm1);
        Monster M2 = new Monster(ref Mm2);
        M1.Go();
        M2.Go();
    }
} 

public class MonsterMove_v2 : MoveBase, IMove_v1
{
    public MonsterMove_v2(GameObject gameObject) : base(gameObject) {}

    void IMove_v1.Foward()
    {
        _m_GameObject.X = _m_GameObject.X + 2;
        _m_GameObject.Y = _m_GameObject.Y + 2;
    }
}

public class MonsterMove_v1 : MoveBase, IMove_v1
{
    public MonsterMove_v1(GameObject gameObject) :base(gameObject) {}

    public void Foward()
    {
        _m_GameObject.X = _m_GameObject.X + 1;
        _m_GameObject.Y = _m_GameObject.Y + 1;
    }
}
```
#### Now we have MonsterMove_v1 and MonsterMove_v2, we only need to decide which method should we use when we initialize Monster.

### 3. Liskov substitution principle
#### Let's look at the following example.
```c#
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        GameObject GO1 = new GameObject();
        GameObject GO2 = new GameObject();
        MoveBase Mm1 = new MonsterMove_v1(GO1);
        Monster Monster = new Monster(Mm1);
        Dog Dog = new Dog(Mm1);

        Monster.Go();
        Dog.Go();
    }
}

public class Monster
{
    private MoveBase _move;

    public Monster(MoveBase monsterMove)
    {
        _move = monsterMove;
    }
    
    public void Go()
    {
        MonsterMove_v1 m = _move as MonsterMove_v1;
        if (null != m) {
            m.Foward();
            Console.WriteLine("I am Monster. I go with " + m.Show());
        }
    }
}

public class Dog
{
    private MoveBase _move;

    public Dog(MoveBase dogMove)
    {
        _move = dogMove;
    }
    
    public void Go()
    {
        MonsterMove_v1 m = _move as MonsterMove_v1;
        if (null != m) {
            m.Foward();
            Console.WriteLine("I am Dog. I go with " + m.Show());
        }
    }
}

public class MonsterMove_v1 : MoveBase, IMove_v1
{
    ...
    
    public string Show()
    {
        return "Monster Walk.";
    }
}
```
#### The console will show "I am Monster. I go with Monster Walk." and "I am Dog. I go with Monster Walk.". To some people, there is nothing strange. A dog can walk like a monster is really cool. However, if your design is that a dog would never walk like a monster, there is something wrong on your design. The design breaks "Liskov Substituion Principle", which is "Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types". In this case, Dog should not accept MoveBase parameter type but a more precise parameter type, for example, DogMoveBase. And Monster, vise versa. The contradiction would be solved.

### 4. Interface segregation principle
### * 
### 5. Dependency inversion priciple
### *
## When should we use inheritance, and when should we use composition?
### A property is belong to the class and the property can be shared to many similar classes. In this case, the property would be extracted from the class and keep in the super class. At that time, inheritance is used. Taking below as an example.
```c#
public abstract class Animal 
{
    object left_front_foot, right_front_foot;
    object left_back_foot, right_back_foot;
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
}

public class Pig : Animal
{
}
```
### Cat should be born with 4 feet. That is its nature. The feet is not pluged by other and they are rarely changed. Hence, the inheritance is used to deal with this case. 
### Compisition is more like a "Has a" relationship. That's say cats are born with 4 feets (Most of the time). Some of the cats has clothing but some don't. In this scenario, we should use compisition to handle clothing. The clothing is worn by cat but not native to cat. Here is the example.
```C#
public class Clothing
{
    public int color;
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    private Clothing _m_Clothing;
    public Cat(Clothing clothing)
    {
        _m_Clothing = clothing;
    }
}
```
### The idea of compisition and inheritance is that the object is native to the class, you should use inheritance while the object is not combined with the class, you should use compisition.

## What is dependency injection? What benefits does it brings?
## What does coupling means? Whatâ€™s the value of Law of Demeter?
## What is side effects?
## What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?
## Why does unit test matter? How does unit test help for refactoring?
## By the arguments above, please analyze pros & cons of the singleton pattern.
## What is Design by Contracts? Why should we crash as early as possible?
